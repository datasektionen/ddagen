The price tag includes food for all attending students and drink coupons for you to hand out to students who mingle with you. This event will also be held in collaboration with our 40th anniversary, which includes more marketing for your company.",
    fullParagraph4:
      "This event is similar to the after-work/office visit events. A case event gives you an opportunity to test the students’ skills while providing them with a fun challenge. Depending on the type of case provided it can also be a good way for the students to get a feel for what it is like to work at your company. We handle marketing of the event, booking of premises and ordering food and drinks for everyone attending. We can also assist in planning the case event if desired.",

      "D-Dagen is an annual trade fair organized by the Computer Science Student Association at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology). At D-Dagen, companies have the opportunity to meet and interact with potential future employees from KTH. At the same time, we offer our students a chance to learn more about career opportunities, network, and participate in lectures and other company events.",
    paragraph2:
      "D-Dagen started in 2015 with 35 participating companies. The following year, the fair moved to the Nymble student union building, which has been the venue for subsequent editions of D-Dagen. The fair has grown every year, except for the pandemic year of 2020. This year, we are aiming to have over 100 companies in attendance. We also expect around 3000 students to visit the fair.",
    paragraph3:
      "Over time, D-Dagen has evolved into much more than just a one-day fair. In the weeks leading up to the fair, we give companies the opportunity to hold lunch lectures and other events together with our students. In the evening after the fair, we organize a larger dinner where students and company representatives can engage in more relaxed conversations.",
